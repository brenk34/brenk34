### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Brandon(He/Him), I am an aspiring software developer that has left the automotive industry after 10+ years.
I am currently enrolled in a Tech Elevator cohort to get the necessary basis to suceed in this industry!
Any tips right now would be much appreciated as it can be overwhelming at times - BUT I'm always looking forward, never back.
Hobbies of mine are driving & working on cars, video games watching football all day. Go Cowboys!
I can be reached by email @ renkb34@gmail.com.
GodSpeed to all.
